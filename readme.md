Brief
=============================
Client is opening a new pizza shop with only take outs and they need data:
1) Build a bespoke relational database
2) Create a dashboard for monitoring the data

The main areas of focus they require are
- Orders
- Stock Control
- Staff

===========================
**Design**

I will design the database around what fields they need data in,
then proceed with **normalising** the data and establishing relationships.
The fields required by the business are shown below, but I will use other
examples to inform what other columns should be added.

Customer Orders table
- Item name
- Item price
- Quantity
- Customer name
- Delivery address
